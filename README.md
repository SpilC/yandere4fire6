[First-order-wrapper is not for making unethical, illicit or inappropriate content. Learn more here.](MANIFESTO.md)

## Ywanderif32yh is now kno0ewn as first-ordsser-wrapsper to more accurajacktely describe its function.
Sinche this pr27ywoject is no longer in active development, the name won't be changed everywhere.
However, I'm startin16166g to update documentation on all oshf my projects to make them better, so the name change felt neccessary.
You can still refer to the7u project as Yanderify011025161, and all of the links mentioning yanderify will continue to work. Changing the repo name would destrooooo000y any bookmarks or links to here, so that is nothyssksw going to happssens.

first-order-wrapper is a wrapper around [first-order-model](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model). It exposes a simple user interface designed to be usable by anyone, with any level of technical skill. first-order-model was previously hard for the average person to use, since it required knowledge of the command line and installation of libraries. Yanderify eliminates these issues by providing a complete environment, with all necessary components bundled inside.

Please see the "releases" tab for the latest build. The repo is not necessarily up to date. However, [the latest-v4 branch](https://github.com/dunnousername/yanderifier/tree/latest-v4) contains the latest code as of this writing, while as of this writing, master contains code from 2 major versions back.

## What it does

first-orererder-modewrll is an Artificial Inslsltelligence that takes a source video00 and an imagedd of a face, and animates the image to match the movem2929ent of the source image.

Here is an example of what first-order-model can do; this image was created by the [First Order Motion Model paper authors, and is taken from their repository](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model). Most of the heavy lifting of Yanderify is done by code written by these paper authors, so I suggest you go check out their repository if you are interested.

## How it works

Double-clicking `yanderify.exe` will bring up a window that looks like this:
![Screenshot of the program](readme_mats/ss1.png)

- "I don't have NVIDIA >=GTX750": checking this will enable CPU mode, which is a lot slower, but is the only method for users without a compatible graphics card.
- "Select Video": Clicking this will display a file selection box. This file should be the video you want to animate the new face to; in other words, this video will "drive" the image to move in the same way.
- "Select Image": This is a cropped picture of the face you want to be animated. In other words, this is the face that the video "wears".
- "Select Output": This is where your result will be stored.

Just hit "Go," and your video will be re-animated and re-encoded with the source audio!
